There are three main technical areas - the development process, the application and the tabernacle model.

## Development Process

## Application

Application development will use the [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/) game engine. This provides a simple, free and cross platform game development environment.

Augmented reality will be handled using [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/) and the [ARKit Unity XR Plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@4.2/manual/index.html).

## Tabernacle Model

The model requires both 3D models and textures.

### Models

The models will be created using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

Each major component will have its own model. They will all be assembled in Unity 3D as a single entity.

### Textures

Textures will be created using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
